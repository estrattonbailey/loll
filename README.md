- [@loll/router](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-router)
- [@loll/h](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-h)
- [@loll/state](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-state)
- [@loll/href](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-href)
- [@loll/route-parser](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-route-parser)

## Why?
Some of the existing solutions are either too simple for the Real World™, or have somewhat cumbersome APIs. I set out to create my ideal API, and here it is.

Essentially, I was lucky enough to find myself with some free time and thought it might be fun :)
