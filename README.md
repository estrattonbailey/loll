## loll ðŸ¤£
A fun(ctional) little frontend application framework. **This is not production-ready.** It's fun-ready.

## Features:
1. Async routing, useful for data fetching
2. Fast VDOM-diffing via [Ultradom](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/ultradom)
3. Easy global state management
4. Localized stateful components
5. Tiny: 2.2kb gzipped *with dependencies*

## Usage
The libraries herein can be used individually, or together for a fully fledged front-end application solution.

- [@loll/app](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-app)
- [@loll/router](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-router)
- [@loll/h](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-h)
- [@loll/state](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-state)
- [@loll/href](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-href)
- [@loll/route-parser](https://github.com/estrattonbailey/loll/tree/master/packages/loll-route-parser)

## Why?
Some of the existing solutions are either too simple for the Real Worldâ„¢, or have somewhat cumbersome APIs. I set out to create my ideal API, and here it is.

Essentially, I was lucky enough to find myself with some free time and thought it might be fun :)
